# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to [ParkinPal](https://parking-pal.netlify.app) app.

## Short description

Parking pal is here to help you find a solution to the lack of parkings in cities around the world by making a platform that alows people to share their parkings when not in use.

### Development

In order to make this project we used the react library, and designed it using css.

We also included symbols and logos from the react-symbol,
[google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
Popup created by [sweetalert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/).
App deployed by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Authentication and database

For authentication and database we used [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform.

To use the app you need to create a new account.
After creating the account you will have access to parkings in the database, and you will be able to connect parking owner using provided details.
Parkings data are readable from the database for every user whilst editing or deleting is possible only if you are the owner.
User date is readable only by same user.
